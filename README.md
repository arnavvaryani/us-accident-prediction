# USA Road Accidents Severity Prediction

## Overview
This data science project aims to predict traffic accident severity in the USA using the US Accidents dataset. The project involves extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model implementation.

## Key Components
- **Data Preprocessing**: Involves cleaning, handling missing values, label encoding, and boolean mapping.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new attributes from timestamps like day, month, hour, and accident duration.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of Naive Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. Includes oversampling for data imbalance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Focus on precision, recall, F1-score, support, and accuracy.

## Results
The project identifies Logistic Regression (before oversampling) as the most effective model based on evaluation metrics.

## Conclusion
Insights into accident dynamics highlight the potential of data-driven approaches for improving road safety.
